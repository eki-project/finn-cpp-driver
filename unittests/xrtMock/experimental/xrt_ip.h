     * @brief
     * xrt::ip represent the custom IP
     *
     * @details The ip can be controlled through read- and write register
     * only.  If the IP supports interrupt notification, then xrt::ip
     * objects supports enabling and control of underlying IP interrupt.
     *
     * In order to construct an ip object, the following requirements must be met:
     *
     *   - The custom IP must appear in IP_LAYOUT section of xclbin.
     *   - The custom IP must have a base address such that it can be controlled
     *     through register access at offsets from base address.
     *   - The custom IP must have an address range so that write and read access
     *     to base address offset can be validated.
     *   - XRT supports exclusive access only for the custom IP, this is to other
     *     processes from accessing the same IP at the same time.
